I am a UI/UX designer. I have a bachelors degree in Graphic Design from University of Calcutta and Diploma in Film & Animation Design from Film & Television Institute of India, Pune, INDIA.

My interests lie at the intersections of art, technology and design and my projects range from concepts to web, mobile applications and print design , experience design and storytelling are a few of the areas that excite me tremendously, with the clients like: OXFAM, INDIA HABITAT CENTRE, RADISSON HOTEL, TIMES OF INDIA, NATIONAL SCHOOL OF DRAMA, OPULENT MALL and few more back in India. 

In 2015 I expanded a bit more and currently residing in USA, and enjoys practicing Visual hunger in the form of illustration, design and painting.
I seek to collaborate with companies/entrepreneurs looking to change and create social and economic impact. My goal is to work on a project that helps bring a bit of change and smile in someoneâ€™s life.
